							Create/Find your author page
						</p>
						<p className={classes.answer}>
							Click the user avatar (on the right-hand side of the navigation bar). If your author page already exists, you’ll see the menu item “My Author Page”, which will bring you to your user page.
							<br/><br/>
							If your author page does not yet exist, you’ll see “Create Author Page.” Clicking this will create your author page and bring you to it.

						</p>
						<p className={classes.question + ' ' + classes.bottomless}>
							Add new articles to your author page
						</p>
						<p className={classes.answer + ' ' + classes.bottomless}>
							You can add articles to your author page in 2 ways:
							<ul className={classes.grayList}>
								<li><strong>Add new article</strong></li>
								<ul className={classes.grayList}>
									<li >Click “Add Article” </li>
									<li>This will open the “New article” modal window where you can enter an article’s information (see below for more details on entering/editing the various fields of your article).</li>
								</ul>

								<li><strong>Link pre-existing article</strong>
										<br/>
										If you want to add an article to your author page that is already in our database (for example, because a co-author has already added it on their author page), then:								</li>
									<ul className={classes.grayList}>
										<li>Click “ADD PREEXISTING ARTICLE”</li>
										<li>In the search box that appears, type a few words from the title of the article you want to link (*or* type the last name of one of the article’s authors)</li>
										<li>Select the article in the list, which will add the article to your author page.
										<br/>(Note: your article list is sorted by publication year (most recent first), so if you don’t see your article, it’s probably lower down in your article list.)
										</li>
									</ul>

							</ul>

						</p>
						<p className={classes.question + ' ' + classes.bottomless}>
							Edit an article
						</p>
						<p className={classes.answer}>
							Hover over the card of the article you want to edit, and click “EDIT”. This will open the “Edit Article” modal window where you can edit all article fields.
						</p>
						<p className={classes.question + ' ' + classes.bottomless}>
							Enter information for an article’s metadata fields (* indicates required fields):

										<li><strong>Replication</strong>: An empirical article that reports at least 1 (new sample) replication study of a previously published effect, employing sufficiently-similar methodologies to the original study. Only studies employing methodologies that are 'Close', 'Very close', or 'Exact' according to our <a href="https://curatescience-staging.appspot.com/sitestatic/infographics/replication-taxonomy-v0.4.0.png" target="_blank">replication taxonomy</a> are considered replications (e.g., at minimum employing the same general operationalizations to measure the independent variable(s) and dependent variable(s); see our <a href="https://curatescience-staging.appspot.com/sitestatic/infographics/replication-taxonomy-v0.4.0.png" target="_blank">replication taxonomy</a> for more details).

										<li><strong>Reanalysis – Reproducibility/Robustness</strong>: An article that reports a “result reproducibility” reanalysis (repeating the same statistical analyses on data of an existing published result) or a “result robustness” reanalysis (conducting different statistical analyses on data of an existing published result).</li>
										<li><strong>Reanalysis – Meta-analysis</strong>: An article reporting a (traditional) meta-analysis that combines evidence across previously published studies on a common topic.</li>
										<li><strong>Reanalysis – Meta-research</strong>: An article reporting other kinds of meta-research reanalyses (e.g., use/misuse of statistical tests across published articles/studies).</li>
										<li><strong>Commentary</strong>: A commentary on previous research (with or without collection of new data)</li>
										<li><strong>Conceptual</strong>: A non-empirical article that makes a theoretical or conceptual contribution (including methodological articles with or without use of simulation studies).</li>

										<br/><br/>
										The figure will automatically be added to the article (no need to click “Add Figure”). Repeat these steps to add additional key figures/tables (various enhancements to this feature will soon be implemented, e.g., multiple file uploading and figure/table extraction directly from PDF).
										<br/><br/>
										NOTE: Please ensure that the corresponding figure and table captions are included in the image files of the key figures/tables (<a href="/app/author/etienne-lebel" target="_blank">example</a>).
